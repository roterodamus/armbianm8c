## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

If you want to recreate this build, download [R36S-Armbian](https://github.com/R36S-Stuff/R36S-Armbian) and check out `install.sh`. Read it carefully and execute it on your R36S device. **DO NOT EXECUTE ON YOUR PC!** You will need to expand the file system first; a couple of GB is more than enough.

```bash
sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/roterodamus/armbianm8c.git
cd armbianm8c/
chmod +x install.sh 
./install.sh 
```
